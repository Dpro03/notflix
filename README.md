## Description

Who doesn't love movies?  I know I do, and while trying to find an awesome application to put in my portfolio and LinkedIn profile, I came across some Netflix clone apps, so I decided to create my own.  I wanted an amusing name, so I came up with Notflix as, not only is it ***NOT*** Netflix, it is an app, specifically because it uses The Movie Database, the user actually ***CANNOT***
view movies.  LOLðŸ¤£&nbsp;&nbsp;  This is because TMDB does not allow that option using their **Free** API.  The user can, however, sign up or log in if they have already signed in, and then they are presented with a random movie image, title, release date and description.  Under this, there are more movie options with the same type of slidebar Netflix uses.  Users can then 'favorite' the movies they choose, as well as delete their favorites by using the heart on the left of the movie to 'favorite', and then the X on the right of a movie they had made a 'favorite' in the past.  These movies that were made 'favorites' can be viewed in the user's account page.  The backend database is hosted by firebase, which is a cloud based mobile and web application development platform.
