## Description

Who doesn't love movies?  I know I do, and while trying to find an awesome application to put in my portfolio and LinkedIn profile, I came across some Netflix clone apps, so I decided to create my own.  I wanted an amusing name, so I came up with Notflix as, not only is it ***NOT*** Netflix, it is an app, specifically because it uses The Movie Database, the user actually ***CANNOT***
view movies.  LOLðŸ¤£&nbsp;&nbsp;  This is because TMDB does not allow that option using their **Free** API.
